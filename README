Alchemy/WebMail version 1.0.1
=============================

 Alchemy WebMail is a Web based mod_perl e-mail client. It relies on
 a database for storing user application data and an IMAP server for
 managing the user's e-mail. 

 Alchemy Webmail should work with any database for which a DBI layer
 exists, the preferred database is PostgreSQL. 

INSTALLATION

 Ensure that you have Apache 2.x and mod_perl 2.x.

 To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

 Database Configuration:

   Load the appropriate schema file into your database according to your
   particular database's methods.  Note that the schema files contain
   only the table and sequence shema, they do not contain any
   authorization information for the database. It is up to the installer
   to set these to their preference.

 Apache Configuration:

   Configure your apache installation for mod_perl and Alchemy WebMail,
   see the Webmail.conf for an example configuration.  
   
   "perldoc Alchemy::Webmail" details all of the configuration options.

   Copy or create templates for your installation of WebMail. The
   default templates are located in the templates directory of the
   source distribution.

   After these steps have been completed you have a dandy web based
   e-mail application running that your users should like, if they know
   what's good for them. ;)
