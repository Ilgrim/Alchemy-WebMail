	  attachments and not lose the message that you were working on.
	- Got the size to show up on messages.

	  get set via clearflag. This is a bit of a hack because this is a

0.24 Thu Jul 31 23:06:04 CDT 2003
	- Got Attachments grabing to work on message view.

	- Got the message ripped apart, now to make it all pretty on the front end.
	- Got the view message started.
